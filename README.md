# Algorithms
In this repository I'll add all of my algorithm implementations.  
I'll use Python3 programming language to implement my algorithms.  

## Topics
### Searching Algorithms
* [**Linear Search**](https://github.com/Mehedi61/Algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/Linear_Search.py)  
* [**Binary Search**](https://github.com/Mehedi61/Algorithms/blob/master/algorithms/Binary_Search.py)

### How to run
Open your Linux terminal and execute the following commands one by one.  

```
https://github.com/Mehedi61/Algorithms.git
```  
```  
cd Algorithms/algorithms/
```  
```  
python3 filename.py
```
That's it.
